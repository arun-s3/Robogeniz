# 🤖 Robogeniz — Robotics Company Landing Page

Robogeniz is a **frontend-only homepage** for a fictional **robot model development company** building robots for homes, industries, factories, and commercial environments such as hotels and service spaces.

This project focuses on  **clean UI engineering, UI design, scalable SCSS architecture, and controlled interaction design.**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Design a **modern, professional fictional tech brand interface** from scratch without being a clone of any existing websites.
* Build a **well-structured, responsive landing page**
* Customize  **Bootstrap at the SCSS level** , not override it blindly
* Keep animations **minimal, intentional, and performance-aware**
* Demonstrate **frontend fundamentals without frameworks**

## 🧩 Page Sections

The homepage is structured as a single, cohesive flow:

* **Nav Menu** — Responsive navigation with brand identity
* **Intro / Hero** — Clear positioning and first impression
* **About Us Summary** — Company overview with animated stats
* **Products** — Robot models and offerings
* **Use Cases** — Home, industrial, factory, and service environments
* **Features** — Core capabilities and differentiators
* **Testimonials** — Social proof and credibility
* **CTA** — Conversion-focused call to action
* **Footer** — Supporting links and brand closure

Each section is  **individually styled, responsive** , and designed to feel consistent as part of a single system.

---

## ✨ Interaction & UI Behavior

* **Scroll-based section reveal** using `IntersectionObserver`
* Subtle **entry animations** for improved visual flow
* Intentional animation restraint — no distracting motion
* Responsive behavior across breakpoints
* Custom SVG brand icon integrated into the design system

All interactions are **DOM-driven** and intentionally minimal.

## 🎨 Styling & SCSS Architecture

SCSS is organized for  **clarity, scalability, and maintainability** :

```
scss/
├── base/
│   ├── _variables.scss
│   ├── _fonts.scss
│   ├── _mixins.scss
│
├── components/
│   └── svg_style.scss
│
├── sections/
│   ├── _navmenu.scss
│   ├── _intro.scss
│   ├── _summary.scss
│   ├── _products.scss
│   ├── _usecases.scss
│   ├── _features.scss
│   ├── _testimonials.scss
│   ├── _cta.scss
│   └── _footer.scss
```

Each section owns its layout, responsiveness, and relevant animations.

---

## 🎨 Theme System & Bootstrap Customization

Bootstrap is  **intentionally customized at the SCSS level** , not overridden after compilation.

A custom theme layer is introduced before Bootstrap is compiled, allowing the design system to remain **consistent, scalable, and framework-aligned** rather than fighting default styles.

**Key characteristics:**

* Centralized color tokens defined once and reused everywhere
* Bootstrap’s theme map extended to include brand-specific colors
* Global variables (backgrounds, link behavior, accents) adjusted before Bootstrap styles are generated
* Zero post-build overrides or hacky CSS fixes

This approach preserves Bootstrap’s utility while keeping the visual identity  **fully brand-driven** .

---

## 🧠 JavaScript Architecture (main.js)

JavaScript is used  **sparingly and purposefully** , focusing only on interaction and state that cannot be expressed through CSS alone.

**Core responsibilities:**

* Revealing sections using the Intersection Observer API
* Triggering animations only when sections enter the viewport
* Ensuring animations run once and do not re-trigger unnecessarily

There are no heavy abstractions, frameworks, or animation libraries

---

## ✨ Interaction Philosophy

Robogeniz follows a  **design-first interaction model** :

* Animations support hierarchy and storytelling
* Motion is subtle, restrained, and purposeful
* No decorative effects without UX justification
* JavaScript enhances the experience without dominating it

So as to make the site professional, modern, and aligned (or atleast close to) with real-world product standards.
